#
# This plugin cancels non-player damage.
# Use damage causes from bukkit:  https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/event/entity/EntityDamageEvent.DamageCause.html
# Case is insensitive.
#
# If a damage cause is not configured the defaults will apply.
#
# For each damage type:
#
#         enabled: Is this damage type enabled?
#                  False means a damage type is processed normally and skipped from this plugin.
#                  If false, the other parameters are not needed.
#                  Default is 'true'
#  percent-chance: Percent chance the damage will be cancelled.
#                  Default is "100".  Meaning damage will be cancelled 100% of the time.
#                  Misconfiguration will use the default value.
#                  Use "rnd" for a random chance from 0 to 100 determined on each damage event.
#  percent-damage: Percent of the damage to be cancelled, provided the damage is to be cancelled.
#                  Default is "100".  Meaning 100% of the dame will be cancelled.
#                  Misconfiguration will use the default value.
#                  Use "rnd" for a random percentage from 0 to 100 determined on each damage event.
